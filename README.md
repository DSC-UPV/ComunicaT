This is ComunicaT, the app for students in the Polytechnic University of Valencia to comunicate effectively at a large scale, in an organized manner.

To test it, download the package and unzip it. Then open it with Android Studio or equivalent. To run it, you must have an emulator or an android device with USB DEbugging enabled connected to your PC. The Flutter and Dart SDK's also need to be installed.

This is just a prototype, what we were able to achieve in the timescale. We would like to continue improving it, the next step would be connectivity to it using Firebase.

Feedback appreciated :)
